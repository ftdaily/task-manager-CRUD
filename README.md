# Simple Task Manager - CRUD

A simple CRUD-based task manager developed to fulfill the requirements for the AP3B course assignment. The application features a backend powered by the Go programming language and is integrated with a frontend designed using the Bootstrap framework and JavaScript for responsive and dynamic user interaction.
## Run Locally

Ensure that the crud database is created in your database management system (DBMS)

```bash
  CREATE DATABASE task_manager;
```

Once the database crud has been created, proceed to import the provided SQL file into the database.

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ftdaily/task-manager-CRUD
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd task-manager-CRUD
```

Start the server

```bash
  go run main.go
```
